java program for a venue selling tickets, merchandise, and beverages


Context: I wanted to learn more with java while feeling like I was gaining some real business-level experience; but in a way that was fun and exciting for me.
Action: I created a java console app. 
Result: The app could sell tickets to customers, handled merchandise, and beverages.
Reflection: I had a lot of fun with this project and got to use java in more of an everyday merchant/customer context.
